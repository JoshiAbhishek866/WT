//await is used as substitute of .then() function, it is aused under async func and async will always give promise object.
//await fun will basically will wait till promise is executed 
//1) async will return promise obj
  //2) await will start run on background
  //3)another thread will work (eg main console instruction) 
  //(example of 3rd point is when a function passess a argument to another function , till that time the execution process is continued by executing other instructions like console.log statements)
